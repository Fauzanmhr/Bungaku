# Overview

This API serves as the backend for the Bungaku mobile app, providing endpoints for retrieving flower information, user authentication, and user profile management.

# API Endpoints

### 1. Get All Flowers

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/flowers?lang={lang}
```

Retrieve information about all available flowers with dual language support (Indonesian and English).

***Example:***
```
curl -X GET localhost:3000/flowers?lang=en
```
```
curl -X GET localhost:3000/flowers?lang=id
```

### 2. Get Flower Data by Name

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/flower/{flower-name}
```

Retrieve detailed information about a specific flower by providing its name with dual language support (Indonesian and English).

Rules :
- If you search with Indonesian language, you need to search with the Indonesian name of the flower.
- If you search with English language, you need to search with the English name of the flower.
- Otherwise, if you do not use any language parameter, it will default to searching in the English database.

***Example:***
```
curl -X GET localhost:3000/flower/matahari?lang=id
```
```
curl -X GET localhost:3000/flower/sunflower?lang=en
```

### 3. User Authentication

#### 3.1 Login

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/login
```

Authenticate a user with their email and password.

***Example:***
```json
{
    "email": "testing@gmail.com",
    "password": "1234567890"
}
```

#### 3.2 Register

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/register
```

Register a new user with their name, email, and password.

***Example:***
```json
{
    "name": "testing",
    "email": "testing@gmail.com",
    "password": "1234567890",
    "confPassword": "1234567890"
}
```

#### 3.3 Logout

```
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/logout
```

Logout the currently authenticated user.

### 4. User Profile Management

#### 4.1 Get User Detail

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/user/me
```

Retrieve details of the currently authenticated user.

#### 4.2 Update User Profile

```
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/user/update
```

Update user profile information. Use one of the provided examples based on the field you want to update.

***Example:***

- **Update Name:**
  ```json
  {
      "name": "New Name"
  }
  ```

- **Update Email:**
  ```json
  {
      "email": "newemail@example.com",
      "currentPassword": "current_password"
  }
  ```

- **Update Password:**
  ```json
  {
      "newPassword": "new_password",
      "currentPassword": "current_password"
  }
  ```

## Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and Authorization is handled using the `express-session` middleware, creating sessions for authenticated users.


# Dependencies

- **Express**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **Cors**: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
- **Express Session**: Middleware for handling user sessions.
- **Dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- **Sequelize**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Node.js.
- **Connect-Session-Sequelize**: A Sequelize session store for Express Session.
- **Argon2**: A secure and efficient password hashing library.

# Local Deployment

1. Install dependencies:

```
npm install express cors express-session dotenv sequelize connect-session-sequelize argon2
```

2. Set up your `.env` file with appropriate values.

3. Run your application:

```
node index.js
```

Now, your Bungaku API should be running locally on `http://localhost:3000`. Test the API using tools like `curl` or Postman.
